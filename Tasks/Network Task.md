2. I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?

   - Check whether port is open or not
  
     ```
     telnet guvi.com 9000 
     ```
       If port is open, the request will be connected. If not, it will end up with an error
